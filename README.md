#### You can always count on me when
If you have trouble with some coding, just ask me and if I know an answer I will help.
If I don't know the answer I will help to look for a solution.

Also if you need someone to talk to I'm here, I am a good listener ;)

##### A funny story
A couple years ago I went on a ski trip with my student club.

One day the apre-ski was going up the mountain with jenever in our backpacks and go sit down and listen to music and drink jenever.
When it was time to go I was so drunk that they took my skis and made me walk to the lift to go down. But because I was drunk I started walking down the mountain
eventualy taking steps of more than 2 meter because it was a black slope.

Eventually I blacked out after I started rolling down the mountain.
Then afterwards I heard stories that I was skiing down the mountain without skis and when we were in the village that there where to guys
laughing at me who eventually helped me go through the village to the bus stop.
Just imagine me hanging between two big dudes XD

###### TL;DR
When I was on a ski trip at one point I was skiing down the mountain without skis.
