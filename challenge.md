# Markdown

- Repository name: `markdown-challenge`
- Mode: `solo`, and as a class
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `Â½ day`

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

- Write structured content using the _Markdown_ syntax
- Write a README file in Markdown, and push it to GitHub

Remember: write **Markdown**, and _not_ **HTML** (this will come tomorrow) ðŸ˜‰

## The Mission

For this exercise, you will create a personal profile page in Markdown, and push it to GitHub. All your profile pages will be linked one to the other, so that you have a comprehensive list of people for the whole class.

## Instructions

1. Create a repository called `markdown-challenge` on GitHub
2. Clone the repository locally on your computer (I suggest you place this repository - and the future ones - inside a folder called `BeCode`)
3. Create a file called `README.md`, `add` it to the repository, `commit` it, and `push` the changes
4. Fill the README with the following content:

> Your Name (as a large header)
>
> An inspirational quote in _italics_
>
> A (professional) photo of yourself (you can save the file in the repository next to the README file)
>
> "Me, in one sentence" (as a smaller header)
>
> A table with the following structure:
>
> ---
>
> Birthday: dd/mm  
> Favorite color: ?  
> Favorite food: ?  
> Pinneapple on pizza: Yes/No (Extra challenge: make it look like a (un)checked checkbox)
>
> ---
>
> Hobbies (smaller header)
>
> _This should contain a bullet list of your hobbies_  
> _At least on item should contain a sublist, for example if you like movies, maybe make a sublist of some movies you really like._
>
> You can always count on me when... (smaller header)
>
> _Tell your teammates which positive contribution to the group you will make._  
> _This could be technical, making people feel comfortable, being an organiser..._
>
> A funny story (smaller header)
>
> _Tell a short funny story about your life._
>
> TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)
>
> _Summarise your funny story in one short sentence._
>
> ! IMPORTANT -> At the bottom of the page there should be a next and previous link, this should link to the page of the previous student (alphabetically) and the next one.  
> Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.
>
> The links should have the following structure:
>
> << previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
